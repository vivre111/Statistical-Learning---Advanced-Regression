## Statistical Learning - Advanced Regression

This course introduces modern applied regression methods for continuous response modelling, emphasizing both explainability and predictive power. Topics cover a wide selection of advanced methods useful to address the challenges arising from real-world and high-dimensional data; methods include robust regression, nonparametric regression such as smoothing splines, kernels, additive models, tree-based methods, boosting and bagging, and penalized linear regression methods such as the ridge regression, lasso, and their variants.
